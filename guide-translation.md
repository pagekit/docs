# How to create a translation

<p class="uk-article-lead">We work with Transifex. It‘s a simple and easy platform where you can share language files to work together on translations.</p>

Feel free to join the official [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex. After a fast [sign up](http://www.transifex.com/signup/) you can help correct existing translations or add your own language.

## First steps

Go to the overview of the Pagekit project. There you can see a list with all languages which were made till now.
You will then have different options:

- Contribute to an existing translation
- Request a new language
	- After approving your request:
		- start with a translation in Transifex's editor
		- Upload an existing .po file to Transifex

## Contribute to an existing translation

If you would like to improve or complete an existing translation, go to the [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex and choose the language you want to contribute to. You will then see all extentions as „Resources“ that can be translated:

| Extention    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Blog         | Resource: Pagekit CMS » Blog » language e.g. French |
| Installer    | Resource: Pagekit CMS » Installer » language e.g. French |
| Page         | Resource: Pagekit CMS » Page » language e.g. French |
| System       | Resource: Pagekit CMS » System » languagee.g. French |

For any translation steps in the Pagekit project you must first click the „Join team“ button which you can find in every language folder on the right side to get access to the language team. We need to approve your contribution so that you are a member of the team and allowed to translate the project. 

Choose the resource you want to contribute to by clicking it. A window opens which shows you all options. By clicking "Translate now" you will come to Transifex's editor which allows you to translate directly without down- and uploading any files.

### Request a language

If your language is not listed you can add a new language to the project. Therefore go to the [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex and add a new language by clicking the button on the right side „Request language“. We will then get notified and will review and approve your added language.

After we approved your request you will then have two options:

### Start the translation in Transifex's editor

If your requested language was approved you can start to translate the extentions, in Transifex called "Resources". Therefore just click the resource you want to work on and press the button "Translate now". The Transifex editor opens immediately where you can start to translate without loading any files.


### Upload a .po file
In case you already created a .po language file you can upload your .po file easily by clicking on the resource and „Upload file“.

A green bar in each column shows you the completeness of a translation.

# Translating Pagekit

<p class="uk-article-lead">We work with Transifex, a simple and easy platform
where you can share language files and work together on localization.</p>

Feel free to join [Pagekit on Transifex](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit).
After a fast [sign up](http://www.transifex.com/signup/) you can help correct
existing translations or add your own language.

## Contribute to an existing translation

If you would like to improve or complete an existing localization, go to
[Pagekit on Transifex](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) and
choose the language you want to contribute to. You will then see all *Resources*
that can be translated.

To take part in the Pagekit project, you must first click the *Join team* button
in the language folder. Once we've approved your request, you will be able to
access the language team and can start to translate the project. Thanks!

Choose the resource you want to contribute to by clicking on it, this will open
an options screen. By clicking *Translate now* you will enter the Transifex
editor which allows you to translate on the fly without having to down- and
upload the files.

## Request a language

If your language is not listed, you can add a new language to the project. To do
so, go to the [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/)
on Transifex and add a new language by clicking the button on the right side
*Request language*. We will then get notified and can review and approve your
added language.

Following our approval, you will have two options:

### Start the translation in the Transifex editor

If your requested language was approved, you can start to translate the
extensions or *Resources* as they are called in Transifex. Just click the
resource you want to work on and press the button *Translate now*.

### Upload a .po file
In case you already created a .po language file, you can upload it easily by
clicking the resource and then *Upload file*.

A green bar in each column shows you the progress of each localization.

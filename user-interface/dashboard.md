# Dashboard
The Dashboard is the first thing you see when entering the Pagekit admin panel. All information you find here, e.g. statistics on your site's activity, comes from widgets configured by the user - each user's dashboard can look different.

It is up to you what information you want to have displayed here. To manage which widgets are being displayed, they configuration and order they appear in, go to _System > Dashboard_.

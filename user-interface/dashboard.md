# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first thing you see when entering the Pagekit admin panel. All information you find here, e.g. statistics on your site's activity, comes from widgets configured for the whole project. In Pagekit you only have to set up the Dashboard once and it will be available for all users of the site. Keep that in mind in case there’s certain information you do not wish to share with all users, e.g. your Analytics.

## Add widgets to the Dashboard

Click the *Add Widget* button in the top right hand corner. You will see a dropdown of all available widgets. Select the one you would like to add.

## Edit widgets

When you hover over a widget, an *Edit* icon will appear in the top right hand corner of the widget. Click it to enter Edit mode. Modify all settings you want to change and confirm by clicking the *checkmark* icon in the top right hand corner of the Widget.

## Arrange widgets

You can arrange widgets by simply dragging and dropping them on the Dashboard. On large screens widgets are displayed in three columns, which makes it easier to arrange them. On smaller screens they will be rearranged automatically depending on the device size.

## Install more widgets

Any extension in Pagekit can provide additional widgets for the Dashboard. Head over to the Marketplace and see what is currently available. A good one to try is the Analytics extension, which allows you to display your Google Analytics data in beautiful graphs.
